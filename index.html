                            <p>The Gordian Knot is often used as a metaphor for an intractable problem (untying an
                                impossibly tangled knot) solved easily by finding an approach to the problem that
                                renders the perceived constraints of the problem moot.</p>
                            <p>The Gordian Agency is a professional blockchain development warehouse with over 25 devs
                                dedicated to blockchain focused projects and companies. We cut through the perceived
                                knots, untangle them, and present them to our clients so they are easily
                                solved with trust and precision. As project developers, we know the pain of starting and
                                maintaining a blockchain based business.We also are aware of the pitfalls and smart
                                contract auditing necessary to succeed in an ever growing competitive marketplace.
